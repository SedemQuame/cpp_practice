structs houseType{
    string style;
    int numOfBedrooms;
    int numOfBathrooms;
    int numOfCarsGarage;
    int yearBuilt;
    int finishedSquareFootage;
    double price;
    double tax;
}

struct varaibles can be declared when the variable is created
structs houseType
{
    string style;
    int numOfBedrooms;
    int numOfBathrooms;
    int numOfCarsGarage;
    int yearBuilt;
    int finishedSquareFootage;
    double price;
    double tax;
} tempHouse;

the above statment declares tempHouse as tye houseType

Accesing struct members
